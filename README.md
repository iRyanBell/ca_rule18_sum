# rule_73_outer_totalistic
A 1D cellular automata using a ruleset where Left=1; Right=1; Center=2;

In this 5-bit 1-dimensional cellular automata enumeration, #18 (corresponding to rule 73) appears the most interesting.

Return True if none of the cells are active or if a cell and one of its neighbors are active.
